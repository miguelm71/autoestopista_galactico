# autoestopista_galactico
This are my 42' projects. You can do whatever you want with them but I strongly recommend to program your onw ones.

## ft_printf 
It is the first implementation I did. I used linked lists therefore the performance is really poor.

## ft_printf2
It is the second chance for this project. It passed with bonuses.
